Congratulations! After four years of test prep and ACTs, you've finally been
accepted to your dream school: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Text-Editing!
Each student's wand is special; you feel lucky that your mentors got
you one made of Vim, a magical material. Two weeks into school, Professor
McGonagall makes a very important announcement during her first Transfiguration
class.

> McGonagall: Welcome to Transfiguration! Transfiguration deals with the
> modification and vanishing of [text] objects. When transfiguring, it is
> important to make firm and decisive wand movements. Do not wiggle or twirl
> your wand unnecessarily, or the Transfiguration will certainly be
> unsuccessful!

> For starters, lets try transforming these animals into their adult form. Try
> doing so in ONLY ONE SPELL [command].

> We can make things disappear. Try making all the enclosed objects (and trash)

> McGonagall: Great job! Sometimes we want to recast our spells without

> Try changing each of the enclosed objects into a "flower".
> Delete the object (enclosure included) if it contains trash.

Ipsum ir kļuvis par vispārpieņemtu teksta aizvietotāju kopš 16. gadsimta
sākuma. Tajā laikā kāds nezināms iespiedējs izveidoja teksta fragmentu, lai
nodrukātu grāmatu ar burtu paraugiem. Tas ir ne tikai pārdzīvojis piecus
gadsimtus, bet bez ievērojamām izmaiņām saglabājies arī mūsdienās, pārejot uz
datorizētu teksta apstrādi. Tā popularizēšanai 60-tajos gados kalpo
