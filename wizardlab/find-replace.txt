Ron Weasley, the star Keeper who made a game saving play to win the quidditch
match for Gryffindor, is very confused. He has a letter that he's trying to
read, but he can't understand it.

It seems like someone made a widespread typo in the letter: Whenever they tried
to type "play" or any word containing "play", they got it wrong (with the same
mistake every time). Use your editor's find and replace feature to fix the typos
in the text so that Ron can read it.

Here's the text:

Ron,

  This is your coach. Your playing has been really good this season, and I want
  to talk about how we can get other people to play at your level. When you
  play, you make everything look really easy and I think the other players could
  learn a lot from you.

  Can you meet with me to look at the playback from some of your games and talk
  to me about what you do and how you make it look so easy?

  Thanks, and play on!

Madam Hooch
