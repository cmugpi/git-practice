Charlie and Taylor have been in love for a long time now. Charlie knows he
wnats to marry Taylor, but Taylor just isn't ready for it. He knows he can
to Taylor that he is ready to make a commitment of this magnitude. Charlie
enlists help from you, his very best friend, to help him make that happen.

Charlie has never really made an effort with Taylor's parents. To be fair,
they never really liked him much either. But Charlie knows that winning them
over is something he needs to do to earn Taylor's hand in marriage.

You pull up into Taylor's parents driveway with Charlie in the passenger seat.
He's shaking-- clearly extremely nervous. You agree to wait for him outside
while he speaks to them.

45 minutes later, Charlie comes out of the house. You can't quite tell how it
went, but Charlie looks like he has quite a bit to say. As soon as he gets
back in, he tells you a crazy story:

Charlie met Taylor's parents over a lovely dinner that Taylor's parents arranged at their house.

After a good night sleep, you wake up to another text from Charlie.

> "She agreed to meet me for coffee! Please come along, you know I have
> trouble making conversation!"

You know he's talking about Ashley, Taylor's best friend. She and Charlie have
never really gotten along, so you agree to be there to make sure things go
smoothly.

You meet Charlie at the local hipster coffee shop. You find him and Ashley
sitting at a table, somewhat awkwardly. You sit down and start to make
conversation with them. All of a sudden, they both seem a lot more friendly.
It seems like things are going well! Until...

Charlie then went on to befriend Taylor's best friend, so Taylor and her best friend can hang with Charlie!

Glad to have that experience behind you, you ask Charlie what his next move is.
Charlie says he is ready to propose, and thinks Taylor will say yes!

Lo' and behold, he was correct. After a beautiful wedding, the two go home
a married couple. You're quite satisfied with the relationship you helped
cultivate.
